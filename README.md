# Motivated Introduction to Sheaves and Cohomology
Sheaves are essential objects of study in algebraic geometry and their cohomology theory is a powerful tool in their study. 
Sheaf theory and cohomology may sound scary to those beginning their journey into algebraic geometry, 
but these concepts are more intuitive than it might seem at first. This expository article is my attempt to convey the
beauty and usefulness of sheaf theory to the student with basic knowledge of varieties.

This article grew out of a [UROP](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/) project I completed at Imperial after the second year
of my Undergraduate degree. I wasn't happy enough with the article to publish it after the summer, but a good friend
of mine convinced me to polish it and put it online.
