\section{Sheaves}
The category of sheaves which takes values in an abelian category is
itself abelian, so we can do homological algebra in it.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:ses_equivalence}
  For a collection $(\mathscr{F}_{i})_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of sheaves on
  a variety $X$ and maps ${\mathscr{F}_{i}\to\mathscr{F}_{i+1}}$,
  the following are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item The sequence
          \[
          \begin{tikzcd}
            \cdots \arrow{r} & \mathscr{F}_{i-1}\arrow{r}
            & \mathscr{F}_{i}\arrow{r} & \mathscr{F}_{i+1}\arrow{r} & \cdots
          \end{tikzcd}
          \]
          is exact.
    \item There is an open cover $(U_{j})_{j\in\mathbb{I}}$ of $X$ such that
          the sequence
          \[
          \begin{tikzcd}
            \cdots \arrow{r} & \mathscr{F}_{i-1}\mid_{U_{j}}\arrow{r}
            & \mathscr{F}_{i}\mid_{U_{j}}\arrow{r}
            & \mathscr{F}_{i+1}\mid_{U_{j}}\arrow{r} & \cdots
          \end{tikzcd}
          \]
          is exact for every $j\in I$.
    \item For every $P\in X$, the induced sequence
          \[
          \begin{tikzcd}
            \cdots \arrow{r} & (\mathscr{F}_{i-1})_{P}\arrow{r}
            & (\mathscr{F}_{i})_{P}\arrow{r}
            & (\mathscr{F}_{i+1})_{P}\arrow{r} & \cdots
          \end{tikzcd}
          \]
          is exact.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
